#CAS Project
This is my CAS Project for the IB Diploma Program Exam, exam session May 2018 and 2019. I will not put my name and school here for privacy reasons, but if you have questions, make a commit and I will contact you back. The purpose of this CAS Project is to design a website that hosts math information that students can refer to anytime. I will begin with Calculus but will eventually expand into Secondary Math (U.S. level math).

##Getting Started
It's just a website with HTML, CSS, and JS files, so feel free to view and clone the files as you wish.
