Welcome to your first calculus lesson! We'll be starting with a fundamental concept to calculus known as **limits**.

Before we go in depth with formal definitions, we begin with some quick review and motivation to intuitively understand what limits are.

## Review of functions

If you've taken any secondary math, you know that a function usually looks like this: $$y = f(x)$$. All this is saying is take some $$x$ value, plug it into the function, and you get a $$y$$ value. Or, if you're more science-oriented, $$x$$ is your independent variable and $$y$$ the dependent variable.

The letters I used to define the function -- y, f, x -- are more of a stylistic standard than a hard rule. In practice, I could use any letter I want; for example, $$y = g(x)$$ or $$y = g(t)$$. Here $$g$$ is the function, and $$x$$ and $$t$$ are still your independent variables.
