## Just y-values?
So with the example from the last lesson where

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} x^2 = 4
$$

you might start becoming suspicious. Isn't a limit just the y-value of the function at a given x-value?, you might ask. Let's see some more examples, like

$$
\lim_{x \to 3} x^2 = 9
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 4} x^2 = 16
$$

or even changing the function to something like $$f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x + 1$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 1} 3x^3 + 2x + 1 = 6
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to 10} 3x^3 + 2x + 1 = 3021
$$

(note that $$f(1) = 6$$ and $$f(10) = 3021$$ as well).

Now you might be convinced that limits are just y-values.
