## Review of functions

If you've taken any secondary math, you know that a function usually looks like this:

$$
y = f(x)
$$

All this is saying is take some $$x$$ value, plug it into the function, and you get a $$y$$ value. Or, if you're more science-oriented, $$x$$ is your independent variable and $$y$$ the dependent variable.

The letters I used to define the function -- $$y,\,f,\,x$$ -- are more of a stylistic standard than a hard rule. In practice, I could use any letter I want; for example, $$y = g(x)$$ or $$y = g(t)$$. Here $$g$$ is the function, and $$x$$ and $$t$$ are still your independent variables.

This is a fairly simple concept that many students seem to get tripped up on. Don't be confused by the different letters. The letter between the parentheses is the independent variable, and the letter on the other side of the equal sign is the dependent variable.

Now, suppose the function $$f(x) = x^2$$.

If we plug a number into the function, say $$x = 2$$, we get

$$f(2) = 2^2 = 4$$

We simply take whatever is between the parentheses and replace $$x$$ with it. That means we can plug in things other than numbers, like constants denoted by letters. For example, let $$x = a$$ where $$a$$ is just some real number, then

$$f(a) = a^2$$

So, again, don't be confused the different letters you will see. Just look in the parentheses and you'll know what to do.
